### My Changes

I made some changes that were different from the original project.

* I used the word 'loan' instead of mortgage.
* I used a dark blue for active states on the input fields.
* I used real time validation.
* I set a minimum and maximum values for loan term and interest rate.
* The calculate button scales when hovered and clicked.
* The calculate button changes color and becomes disabled if there are any errors.
